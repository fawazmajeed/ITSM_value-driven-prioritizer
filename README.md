# ITSM Value-Driven Prioritizer Playbook

**Transforming Problem Management from a cost center into a strategic value-creation engine.**

This repository contains the assets and source code for the "Value-Driven Prioritizer," an ITSM playbook designed to help Problem Managers move beyond traditional, reactive prioritization methods. It introduces a data driven framework that aligns problem solving efforts directly with business value.

### The Prioritization Paradox: Why This Playbook Exists

Traditional problem management often relies on gut feelings, technical severity, or the "loudest voice" in the room. This approach fails to account for the true, quantifiable impact on the business.

**My vision is to reframe Problem Management around ROI.** This playbook provides a practical, step-by-step guide to help you confidently answer the question: *"What should we fix next to deliver the most value to the business?"*

### Playbook Structure

This playbook is structured as a journey from traditional ITSM to a new paradigm of data driven, value focused decision making.

| Chapter | Title | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Intro** | The Prioritization Paradox | Why traditional methods fail; introducing "Problem Management ROI." |
| **Chap 1** | The ITIL Foundation: Good, But Not Great | Acknowledging ITIL's strengths while identifying its strategic gap in prioritization. |
| **Chap 2** | Step 1: Quantify the Impact | Calculating a quantitative `Impact Score` using data analytics, financial analysis, and NLP. |
| **Chap 3** | Step 2: Capture Business Strategy with AHP | Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to model business objectives mathematically. |
| **Chap 4** | Step 3: The Multi Criteria Ranking Engine | Combining impact and business weights with TOPSIS to create a definitive problem backlog ranking. |
| **Chap 5** | Step 4: Optimize the Solution | Using Linear Programming to create an optimal execution plan based on resource constraints. |
| **Chap 6** | Conclusion: From Engineer to Strategic Partner | Elevating the Problem Manager's role from technical firefighter to a strategic business partner. |

### How to Use This Repository

*   **/data**: Contains sample datasets, including `problem_records.csv`, to use with the models.
*   **/templates**: Includes Excel/Google Sheets templates for the AHP survey and TOPSIS ranking model.
*   **/scripts**: Contains the Python script (`optimizer.py`) for the prescriptive analytics model described in Chapter 5.
*   **/notebooks**: (Coming soon) Jupyter Notebooks with detailed, step-by-step walkthroughs of the analytical models.

### Get Started

1.  **Read the Playbook:** Start by reviewing the concepts in each chapter to understand the methodology.
2.  (https://www.notion.so/Playbook-The-Value-Driven-Prioritizer-28cf1f30861c8043b9dad3b12d1e5c37?source=copy_link).
3.  **Explore the Data:** Familiarize yourself with the sample data in the `/data` directory.
4.  **Use the Templates:** Apply the AHP and TOPSIS templates to your own problem backlog.
