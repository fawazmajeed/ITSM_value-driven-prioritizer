# ITSM_value-driven-prioritizer
Playbook on ITSM value driven prioritizer. Integration Data and Decision science into ITSM problem management framework

**Introduction: The Prioritization Paradox**
The Pain Point: Why traditional problem prioritization fails (gut-feel, loudest voice).
Our Vision: Introducing "Problem Management ROI" as a value-creation engine.

**Chapter 1: The ITIL Foundation—Good, But Not Great**
Content: Quick overview of the standard ITIL Problem Management process.
The Strategic Gap: Highlighting that ITIL explains how but not which problems to prioritize with data.

**Chapter 2: Step 1—Quantify the Impact**
The Goal: Move from qualitative descriptions to a quantitative Impact Score.
Data Analytics: Using incident data to calculate total business hours lost.
Financial Analysis: Correlating outages with financial data (e.g., lost sales, SLA penalties).
NLP for XLA: Generating a "User Frustration Score" from tickets and surveys.
Deliverable: Scoring template for the total Impact Score.

**Chapter 3: Step 2—Capture Business Strategy with AHP**
The Goal: Replace opinion with a mathematical model of business values.
Decision Science (AHP): A step-by-step guide to conducting an Analytic Hierarchy Process workshop.
Deliverable: AHP survey template and guide to calculate final priority weights.

**Chapter 4: Step 3—The Multi-Criteria Ranking Engine**
The Goal: Combine the Impact Score and Business Weights for a definitive ranking.
Decision Science (TOPSIS): A simple explanation of the TOPSIS method.
Deliverable: Excel/Google Sheets template with a pre-built TOPSIS model.

**Chapter 5: Step 4—Optimize the Solution with Prescriptive Analytics
**
The Goal: Determine the optimal set of problems to fix based on resource constraints.
Prescriptive Analytics (Linear Programming): Framework and Python script for a Linear Programming model.
Deliverable: Documented Python script.

**Chapter 6: Conclusion—From Engineer to Strategic Partner**
Content: Summary of the framework's value.
Call to Action: Invitation for community adoption and feedback.
